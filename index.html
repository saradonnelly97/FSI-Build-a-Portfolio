    <!-- 
      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded

        <p class="tigerhole"><b>TIGERHOLE</b></b><br><br>To me, Earthbound (<i>Mother 2</i>) is probably one of the best games of all time. Because of Earthbound, I've gained a really strange sense of humor, which is reflected particularly strongly in my artwork. I enjoy how complex even simple doodles can be. They look like they're easy to draw, but even then, the most simple doodles have a good bit of thought and muscle memory incorporated into them. My goal is to execute my doodles almost as effortless as they look (<i>because they do take me a bit of trial and error before they actually look good!</i>)
<br><br><img src="/images/tiger.GIF" height="220" align="left" alt="An animated GIF of Sara's painting 'Tiger Hole' wiggling to and fro. It's kinda charming.">For example; These paintings took a little over four hours to make each. The original painting was the Tiger. I haven't painted using acrylics in some time, let alone ever tried a 'line-less' painting style. My first step was painting the 4inx4in canvas Candy Pink. After the background layer dried, I sat down and drew out my funky little tiger in pencil. From there, things got a bit tricky. I went straight for a layer of orange, getting the paint as flat as possible without laying down big globs of paint. When I created pieces previously, I was so enamored by the texture of the paint alone that I would slap down the thickest gobs of paint I possibly could. Reach resulted in very long dry times as well as an expensive muddy mess. When I put down the initial layers, I left a significant amount of space between the paint and the pencil lines; I was too scared to ruin my beautiful drawing... With a leap of faith, I went for trusting the colors to work for themselves and painted over the sketch completely. After the base colors were established, I got a bit lost. What could I do to bring this painting all together? It came to me; I could draw on it. Following my move-in, I'd unearthed a pack of beautiful, Windsor-Newton watercolor pencils. The best way to bring any piece together is to make sure there is a proper amount of red, blue, and yellow. These three colors somehow manage to trick the mind into thinking a piece is complete. Don't quote me on that, but I remember my painting professor mentioning something about it very briefly in one of our first classes back in the day... Not only that, but I noticed that the pencils added a wonderful amount of texture to the painting as well. Once the shading was added, I added all the black details with a felt-tip art pen. And Voila! Tiger Hole was complete.
<br><br><img src="/images/cheetah.GIF" height="220" align="right" alt="An animated GIF of Sara's painting 'Tiger Hole 2' wiggling to and fro. It's kinda fierce.">The next day, I realized I had two more 4inx4in canvas that I could paint, and honestly Tiger Hole looked a little lonely. I wanted to make another big cat, but I also knew that I wanted to make the paintings look like they were interacting. Like they belonged together. This time, I approached the painting a little differently.. I sketched my idea out on a piece of notebook paper before commiting it to the canvas. I was nervous that my next drawing wouldn't live up to the quirkiness of Tiger Hole. I'd never drawn or painted in the style that I had the day before and was left surprised I could make something so weird but cool. The sketch I came up with was just so perfect, I was a bit devastated and worried I wouldn't be able to free-hand the exact same sketch again. I came up with a brilliant idea; If I traced the sketch on the other side of the paper, I could re-draw the sketch onto the canvas using the trace! This proved to be an excellent solution, and I from there, I was able to follow the same steps I'd followed with Tiger Hole to create Tiger Hole 2. When I placed the paintings side by side, they sat beside each other, interacting more perfect than I could ever ask for. It was a success.
<br><br><img src="/images/panther.GIF" height="220" align="left" alt="An animated GIF of Sara's painting 'Tiger Hole 3' wiggling to and fro. It resembles a strong, meaty figure.">And then came the moment I was dreading. Fearing. I had <b>one final canvas left</b>. What could I possibly put on this canvas?? What if it doesn't fit in with the other two? What direction should this animal even face? Should I do another big cat or should I do a unicorn? I knew I at least wanted to use a blue canvas. Ok, well, the best creature I could do is probably a panther if I'm wanting these paintings to go together. What color should I make the panther? Black will be way too harsh and will take away from the other two paintings... There were so many questions I asked myself before I finally decided to paint a purple panther. And that's exactly what creating art is all about; it's another form of problem solving, a series of solutions you find only after an extensive session of trial and error. I made multiple sketches of this fella. I just could not get his face or his body to look right! After I finally figured out his silly face, his broad and strong shoulders, I had another problem I had to face. The tracing did not fit onto my 4inx4in canvas. I had two choices; to attempt to free-hand draw the panther onto the canvas OR drag the drawing paper along the canvas as I traced to force it to fit onto the canvas. Aaaaaaannnddd the second choice proved to be the best answer because I didn't want to sit down and draw another panther. This guy was just too perfect. Somehow, I managed to paint the panther much quicker than the other two; Tiger Hole 2 taking me the longest (<i>I had some unfortunate issues with what shade of yellow I wanted and had to re-do the cheetah a couple times!</i>) The blue and red shading fit on perfectly, and I had to add on a lot more definition with the pencils than my other two drawings. I was afraid that because of this, the painting wouldn't fit in with the other two. I waited for it to dry and then...</p>
